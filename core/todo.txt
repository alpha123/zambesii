//List of TODO:s.

//__kclasses
* Decide properly how to get the interface for the alloc table to work in a 
  uniform, clean fashion.

//memoryTrib

//numaTrib
* Add some more fancy stuff for informative purposes, such as current status
  of banks, etc.
* Add a 'dump()' function.

//cpuTrib

// VSwamp:
* Implement backward linking of swamp info nodes. Right now when you free to
  the swamp, the kernel will only join adjacent nodes forward. If there are
  adjacent nodes behind you, it will not join them up, and thus will cause
  fragmentation.

//__kthreads
* Deal with the issue of how to unify the different architecture setups.

// PMM:

// General fixes: Continuation for when you resume:
* Refine include/__kstdlib/compiler
* Run through all PMM code.
* Run through all locking code and optimize for the NUMA, SMP, and UP cases.
* Re-implement all allocation functions in the Memory Tributary.
* From there, all you need to do is take about a week and run through every
  line of code in the kernel and make sure that the constructores are in order,
  then ensure the initialize() sequence is sane.
* Then test the kernel, and ensure it's fine, and bump it up to v0.00.002.


// Plans for v0.00.003:
* Implement the Interrupt Tributary.
* Stub out some hack interface for emulated firmware printing services.

// Plans for v0.00.004:
* Design the Firmware Tributary.
* Re-work the print stub from v0.00.002 to use the emulated print service.
