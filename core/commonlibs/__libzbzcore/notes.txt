	Syslibs:
Every process must have a syslib mapped into it. Syslibs are the syscall
intermediate code that calls into the kernel on behalf of the process. Generally
this involves moving arguments into registers and calling the correct INT vector
to cross the CPU's privilege barrier.

In addition to providing the syscall code for processes, these libraries also
provide the process' entry point. The key purpose of a syslib is to:
	1. Provide an entry point for the process.
	2. Load the process' executable image into memory, do any dynamic
	   relocation needed, and then jump into the process image.
	3. Provide syscall support code for when the process wishes to call into
	   the kernel.

The kernel does not care what executable format the actual process image is
stored in. Zambesii processes can be ELF, PE, Mach-o, A.OUT, or whatever else
exists. The kernel itself does not have any executable format parsing code. It
delegates that functionality to the syslib. As such, the kernel will usually be
"installed" with multiple syslibs: one for each format supported by the host OS
environment.

	__ksyslib: The kernel-internal "syslib":
This syslib is used by in-kernel-image code that is executed in its own process.
Examples include distributaries and in-kernel drivers. The difference between
the kernelspace syslib code and the userspace syslib code is that kernel-space
syslib code:
	1. Does not need to load an executable image from the disk.
	2. Does not need to relocate the code for its process, since code in
	   the kernel image is directly linked to the kernel.
	3. Does not need to provide syscall support code since kernel-image
	   code does not need to syscall to cross a privilege barrier; such code
	   calls directly on other code in the kernel image.

The __ksyslib will generally just provide an entry point for new kernel-image
processes and no more. Because this syslib is for code that is directly linked
into the kernel image, it also does not need to parse executable formats since
all the processes it will be associated with are raw binary code which is linked
into the kernel image...much like the __ksyslib itself.

	__usyslib: The userspace syslib:
These syslibs are generally going to be separate code modules on disk or in the
kernel's ramdisk. They perform all the functions outlined in the first section.
