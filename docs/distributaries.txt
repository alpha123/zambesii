	Introduction.
A Distributary is the nomenclature applied to the concept of a componentialized
kernel subsystem; referred to commonly as a "service" in other kernels.

	Goals.
The aim is to have a simple interface for starting kernel distributaries,
querying their status and applying administrative control to them where needed.

	Approach:
The Distributary management subsystem consists of two primary components:
	1. A Currentt hierarchical namespace of pathed names for the subsystems
	   compiled into the kernel. This namespace, similar to a "file system"
	   namespace will enable distributaries to be referenceable by string
	   names, enabling easy manipulation.

	2. The logic which starts and kills the processes for the distributaries
	   provided with the kernel. This will mostly be provided by the Process
	   Tributary which is where process spawning resides.

	Conceptualization:
Distributaries should be referenceable via paths which resemble normal FS paths,
such as:
	@d:/graphics, or @d:/graphics/reflectionn
	@d:/network, or @d:/network/aqueductt
	@d:/storage, or @d:/storage/cisternn
