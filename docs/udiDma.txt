	Scatter Gather List (SGL):
SGLs are physical page lists. They are simple descriptors of frames, given in
the udi_scgth_t format.

map() returns a VSGL object.
Need methods to manipulate the element array.


	Virtual Scatter Gather List:
VSGLs are an abstraction that works on top of SGLs. A VSGL has accessor methods
such as memcpy which allow it to be written to and read from.

	DMA Descriptor:
Takes a udi_dma_constraints_t object and manages the reification of the DMA
abstraction as requred by the udi_dma_constraints_t object.

Calling udi_dma_prepare causes one of these to be created.

I think this class should be the overseer of the building of udi_scgth_t lists.
An allocate() method on this class causes it to direct the building of a
udi_scgth_t list.

	udi_buf_t:
Can be mapped to a DMA Descriptor, and subsequently unmapped.


		PMM changes:
The PMM changes are mostly going to be about alignment constraints.
