What does process spawning entail?

1. A syscall specifying where the process image data should come from.
* A check to see if the parent process is authorized to create the process.
2. A check to see if the kernel can handle the process' image data.
3. A check to see if the process image can be properly loaded (exec libs).
4. A memory allocation of the process' process Stream.
	a. If the process is contained, it must inherit its address space.
	b. If not, it must have its new address space allocated by the kernel.
5. The writing of the process' memory image into its address space.
* The reading of the process' entry address.
6. Inheritance of attributes from its parent (environment, exec domain,
   affinity, privilege escalation, creator user, etc)
7. The creation of its first thread.
8. The scheduling of its first thread.

Need to change thread switching to take difference in process address space
into account.

Need to change the way virtual address spaces are stored.

Need to make virtual address spaces directly a member of container processes.

Need to create the new class hierarchy for processes.

	Process hierarchy:

driverProcess
process
|-containedProcess
| +-containedDriverProcess (inherits driverProcess)
+-containerProcess
  |-distributaryProcess
  +-containerDriverProcess (inherits driverProcess)
