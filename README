Cursory information:

ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
	Zambezii is a portable kernel for 32-bit and above platforms which have
	a Memory Management Unit. It is still under very heavy development.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
	I am a human being who lives in a country. If you wish to make contact
	with me, please email me at: latentprion <AT> gmail <DOT> com.

LICENSING:
	This project is licensed under the terms of the GPLv2. Please see
	"LICENSING" for more details. The kernel is currently "free" as in
	"free beer", but will soon no longer be so, but will have a price
	attached at a future date, most likely after release, or sometime
	around then.
