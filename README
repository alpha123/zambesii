Cursory information:

ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
	Zambezii is a portable kernel for 32-bit and above platforms which have
	a Memory Management Unit. It is still under very heavy development.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
	I am a human being who lives in a country. If you wish to make contact
	with me, please email me at: reavengrey <AT> gmail <DOT> com.

LICENSING:
	Zambezii is licensed under the GNU Public License version 2. I chose
	to use this license for public distribution since I prefer to ensure
	that non-open-source projects cannot take code from this kernel.

	WHY?

	Because in doing this kernel, so far I have discovered that without the
	open source movement, I would have had no information, and no resources
	to rely on to get started. Open source is the only thing that gives
	hobbyist kernel developers a fighting chance.

	I DISTRIBUTE MY KERNEL AS OPEN SOURCE; JUST NOT UNDER THE GPL.

	This is a very valid point. What if you have a project which uses an
	open-source model, but is not GPL licensed?

	The GPL works by using copyright law to allow the author to distribute
	his or her work under a license, based on his or her authority to
	distribute. It is up to the copyright holder to decide whether or not
	to pursue legal action against anyone who infringes his or her license.

	I support open source projects. Therefore, I have no problem with
	allowing other projects which conform to the open source model (they
	explicitly make their work available to all distributees at no charge,
	whether upon request, or as a fixed part of the distribution package) to
	make use in full or in part of my source code.

	Basically, if you have an open-source, non GPL project, and want to use
	my code, by all means go ahead. If you have a non-open source project,
	and want to use my code, please look elsewhere.
